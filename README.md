=================
This repository contains:
- an R script
- a Codebook
- this README document.

The R script merges the data from the test and training sets and creates a tidy data set with the mean values for all the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (86 out of 561 variables) of the original data set for each of the six activities across the 30 test subjects.
The codebook describes the variables of the resulting tidy data set, which can be used for downstream analysis. 
The original Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set as well as detailed information on how they were obtained can be accessed via the following URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#
