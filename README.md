=================
This repository contains:
- an R script
- a Codebook
- this README document.

The R script creates a tidy data set with the mean values for all measurements on the mean and standard deviation of the original data for each of the 30 subjects for all 6 activities. 
The codebook describes the variables of the resulting tidy data set, which can be used for downstream analysis. 
The original Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set as well as detailed information on how they were obtained can be accessed via the following URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#
